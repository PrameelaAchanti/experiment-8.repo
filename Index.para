To enhance online hacking safety, use strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication for all accounts, keep all software and operating systems updated with the latest security patches, and be wary of clicking suspicious links or downloading attachments, especially from unknown sources. Additionally, avoid sharing personal information on public networks, use reputable antivirus software, cover your webcam when not in use, and only use secure browsing on trusted networks.
